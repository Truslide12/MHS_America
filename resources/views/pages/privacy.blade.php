<h4>Information on your site activity</h4>
<p>We collect information of your activity on our website such as when registered users "watch" a community / professional or give a "Kudos" to a profile. The user's generated unique ID number is attached to such data for data integrity, but it is relayed anonymously to the communities / professionals to which it applies. This anonymous data provides analytical insight to business owners to the success of their campaign on mhsamerica.com.</p>
