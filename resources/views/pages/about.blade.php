<p>Welcome to the new leading network in the manufactured housing industry. We have developed, designed and have thoughtfully built a site where anyone can find exactly what they are looking for, from communities, homes, home builders,  professionals, dealerships, sales professionals, contractors, and all those services relating to mobile homes. Our goal from day one has been to build a site that everyone in the industry and anyone in the public sector could  join in to make it the number one site in the country.</p>
