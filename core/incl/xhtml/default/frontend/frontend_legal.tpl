		<h1>Terms of Use</h1><br>
		<p>We provide a variety of services as well as share many services provided by others. We also allow you to be involved in the growth and development of our systems and to collect and monitor information you find interest in. As you use our services, we'd like to extend a warm welcome to you on behalf of the MHS America community and provide the following clarification on our data use policies, so you may better understand our relationship with both our partners and the public.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p class="indent1"><strong>Information you give us</strong><br>
At registration, we require some basic information, including name, email address, and desired password.</p>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Information we gather with permission</strong><br>If you participate in our Business Profiles system, we may also collect information both that you give to us and that we find online in public domain. This may include phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, store / office hours, physical addresses, etc. that apply to the entity represented by each profile you do create.</p>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Information on your site activity</strong><br>
We collect information of your activity on our website such as when registered users "watch" a community / professional or give a "Kudos" to a profile. The user's generated unique ID number is attached to such data for data integrity, but it is relayed anonymously to the communities / professionals to which it applies. This anonymous data provides analytical insight to business owners to the success of their campaign on MHS America.</p>

<h2>How we use the information we collect</h2>
<p class="indent1"><strong>Analytics</strong><br>
As mentioned above, data useful to businesses is collected and shared with them in a manner which does not reveal the identity of the individual users or reveal any data not separable from users' identities.</p>

<p class="indent1"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong><br>
Data may or may not be used for troubleshooting issues with the site's functionality.</p>
